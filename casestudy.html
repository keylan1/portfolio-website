              style="float: right; max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
            <p>The focus of this phase was establishing the backbone of the mFlixApp. It involved the creation of a
              RESTful
              API via Node.js and Express, employing a non-relational database, MongoDB, and employing the Mongoose
              library
              for the collection schemas. HTTP endpoints were defined to access the ‘movies’ and ‘users’ collections for
              CRUD
              operations such as returning user info, updating user info, returning the movies list. The endpoints were
              tested
              with Postman.</p>

            <img class="jwt" src="./img/jwt.png" alt="JWT Code Image" style="float: left; width: 50%; height: auto;">
            <p>In order to ensure that no unauthorized CRUD operations could be performed, JWT authentication was
              employed
              to
              require users to sign in and sign up. Password hashing was also implemented to ensure that the user’s
              password
              could not be read even by the database manager.</p>

            <img class="reactmobile" src="./img/reactmobile.jpg" alt="Client-Side Image"
              style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; width: 25%; height: auto;">
            <p>Following the completion of the backend, the emphasis shifted to creating the client-side of a responsive
              movie
              app using React. Using the database and endpoints, I implemented views such as the registration and
              sign-up
              page, user profile with info, favorite movies, ability to edit the profile, and the main page with the
              movies. A
              user has the ability to click on a movie for a dialog with more detailed information on the movie, genre,
              date
              and director. A button also allows the user to favorite or unfavorite the movie.

              For the visual aspects, the UI library React Bootstrap was used. This enabled a more structured and
              uniform
              manipulation of the visuals.

            <p>Later in the course, the client-side was also built with Angular and Angular Material (see image below),

              can be seen on the projects page</p>

            <p>The mFlixApp stands as a testament to my learning in both backend and frontend technologies, providing a

          <!-- Challenges and Learnings Section -->
          <div class="cs-challenges">
            <h2>Challenges and Learnings:</h2>
            <p>The server-side creation appeared more straightforward, though I found experimentation with relational
              databases frustrating and enlightening as it demonstrated that a large amount of the work is done in the
              planning as changing things becomes complicated. The authentication process created the most issues and
              took
              some time to follow properly.

              Regarding the client-side, challenges were encountered in managing prop dependencies in React, extending
              the
              duration of this task beyond the usual and highlights the learning curve associated with React. A literal
              application of console.log(), alerts and error messages were vital in determining what information was
              being
              passed. While the modularity of React is quite impressive, the seeming lack of structure posed the
              greatest
              frustration. Implementing the profile functionalities was the most frustrating as following the thread
              became
              more complicated with the prop dependencies. Experimentation with codebases and external assistance played
              a
              crucial role in overcoming these challenges.

          <div class="cs-future">
            <h2>Future Steps</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my knowledge of React and debugging to improve efficacy, code and to
              enhancing
              the client-side functionality via features such as a skeleton loader. My design is quite basic and could
              stand
              to be improved. Additionally, I’d like to add Redux for state management to organize that more. Overall,
              it
              cemented the notion that in future, in times of frustration, taking a step back and turning focus on
              gaining
              a
              deeper understanding of the material is crucial.</p>
